**Aim:** 
The main aim is to find credible risk factors for obesity and give physicians the tools to prevent a cascade of chronic health issues and increase the quality of life for their patients.
**Research question:**
To study the cause of obesity based on the risk factors related with food habits and physical conditions.
**Prediction:**
Possibly predict the association of obesity with dependent and independent attributes such as Frequency of high-calorie food consumption, frequency of vegetable consumption, and frequency of main meals, alcohol consumption, transportation etc.
The association will then be utilized to create a prediction model that will equip doctors with the knowledge and resources they need to counsel patients, stop a chain reaction of chronic health problems, and ultimately raise the standard of living for the patients.
